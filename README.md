## Hey 👋, I'm B C SAMRUDH 

I'm currently a Undergraduate Student (Computer Science and Engineering) focused on learning Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I'm building some projects to help solidify my learning.
I'm using GitHub to share my projects and code, along with collaborating with others. My projects here will include both my learning experiments as well as some hobby projects I build.  

```python
# !/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

class Developer:

    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "B C Samrudh 😄"
        self.love = "Coding"
        self.location = "Somewhere on Earth 🌍"

    def say_hi(self):
        print("Thanks for dropping by, hope you find some of my work interesting.")

me = Developer()
me.say_hi()
```
